# A program to find out the Chinese zodiac sign for a given year. The Chinese zodiac sign is based on a 12-year cycle, and each year in this cycle is represented by an animalâ€” monkey, rooster, dog, pig, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, and sheep.

# A program that prompts the user to specify a year, and then it displays the animal for that year.
